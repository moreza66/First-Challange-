# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Instead of each div element I used semantic elements like nav in header, main, sections, footer.

## I added the background image to the img tag in src instead of reading from css file.

## I added alt attribute to all img tags.

## I chsnge the title to meaningful discription.

## in css file I chsnged footer class to footer tag because we are no longer using footer clsss in html.

## I changed benefit class padding.

## change div inside of header tag to nav inorder to get the css.
